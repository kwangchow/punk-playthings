								<h1>Punk Playthings</h1>
								<p>Provocations for 21st Century Game Makers</p>
							</header>
							<p class="major">A book about the work of play from Dr. Chris Lowthorpe and Sean Taylor.</p>
							<p class="major"><i>Punk Playthings</i> is an antidote to complacency and orthodoxy. Packed with probes and provocations that explore game making through fresh lenses for uncertain times, it challenges gaming monoculture by constructing a trading space for ideas and learning from across domains and cultures. Punk Playthings has zero respect for boundaries between mediums, industries, sectors, specialisms or disciplines. Instead, it challenges you to expand your cultural capital, think laterally and make new connections.</p>
								<p class="major"><i>Punk Playthings</i> advocates a truly independent mindset and DIY approach for creating playful experiences with cultural resonance. It proclaims creative entrepreneurship as the true legacy of punk.</p>
									<p class="major"><i>Punk Playthings</i> is not for everyone. But it might just be for you.</p>

							<h1>What People Are Saying</h1>
							<p><i>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.</i><br><b>Marie-Claire Isaaman (CEO, Women in Games)</b></p>
							<p><i>"Punk Playthings is overtly political. It challenges game-makers to line up alongside rebellious visionaries from Malcolm McLaren to Quentin Tarantino; to recognise that they are part of a disruptive tradition that casts a skeptical eye to its past and jealous eye to its future."</i><br><b>Professor Gregor White (Head of School of Arts, Media and Computer Games at Abertay University)</b></p>
							<p><i>"It’s been something of a bitter-sweet experience reading through the wisdom Sean and Chris have carefully distilled into Punk Playthings. Part of me is deeply jealous that I never had this book when I was starting my career in game development twenty five years ago. There are lessons on almost every page that are worth their weight in gold. Lessons that took me months - sometimes even years -  to learn. I seriously wish I could go back and hand my younger self a copy of this book when I was starting Denki."</i><br><b>Colin Anderson (CEO, of Denki Ltd. TIGA Board Member)</b></p>

								<h1>About the Book</h1>
								<p>This book is a mosaic. It adopts a contextual and inductive approach where exemplars act as tesserae assembled to make up a unified whole. Or at least, that’s the plan. We display little respect for boundaries between mediums, industries, sectors, specialisms or disciplines. We want this book to function as a trading space for ideas and learning sourced from across domains and cultures. We agree with Steve Jobs – the broader your cultural inputs, the better your creative outputs.</p>

									<h3>Chapter One:<br>The Road Less Travelled</h3>
								</header>
								<div class="content">
									<dl>
										<dd>
											<p>There are exceptional games but there is nothing exceptional about games. As a medium, it is no better or worse than any other.</p>
											<p>This chapter explores creative mavericks who rejected the conventional wisdom and subverted the orthodoxical practices of their chosen mediums and domains. It argues that game makers themselves must move beyond the ghetto of the gamer – and the nostalgic cliches of the traditional game development – to become genuinely independent in their thoughts, intentions and actions. To invent the future, games must take the road less travelled.</p>

										<h3>Chapter Two:<br>Ideals Over Ideas</h3>
									</header>
									<div class="content">
										<dl>
											<dd>
												<p>Meaningful ideals and creative innovation have been replaced by cheap ideas and mediocre invention. Making is important – but only within the wider context of a clear purpose and magical vision. Understanding what you’re trying to do and why it matters is not something to be explored as an afterthought. It is the essence of any designed experience.</p>
												<p>This chapter probes the approximation of authenticity through provocative manifestos and playful cultural appropriation, arguing that critical thinking, polycultural synthesis, and serendipity make a greater contribution to meaningful and resonant playful experiences than slavish authenticity, virtuous craft or technical mastery.</p>

										<h3>Chapter Three:<br>Remake/Remodel</h3>
									</header>
									<div class="content">
										<dl>
											<dd>
												<p>The demise of the traditional publisher model, the democratization of making and an increasingly over-saturated market has left the game sector in a state of flux. To remain relevant, game makers must re-evaluate and re-imagine the cultural inputs and creative outputs that shape their experiences and the experiences they create.</p>
												<p>This chapter suggests that game makers must accelerate the sector’s deindustrialization and disregard premature incorporation, prescriptive processes and commoditization for the masses. Instead, game makers should embrace adaptability and curiosity in order to curate meaningful, playful experiences that surprise and delight audiences.</p>
												<p>Chapter Essays: <i>Into The Unknown</i>, <i>After The Gold Rush</i>, <i>Start a Band Not a Business</i>, <i>Stop Just Making Stuff</i>, <i>The Work of Play in the Age of Digital Reproduction</i>, <i>Threes: A Case Study in Itinerant Iteration</i> and <i>Dear Esther: A Case Study in Challenging Assumptions</i>.</p>

										<h3>Chapter Four:<br>Success Doesn’t Suck</h3>
									</header>
									<div class="content">
										<dl>
											<dd>
												<p>Be a sellout! The modern game maker must simultaneously be the playful provocateur, the sincere trickster, the spellbinding storyteller, the community builder and the artisanal merchant. Being just one out of five – the isolated, stubborn maker – is no longer enough. Define yourself by vision and purpose rather than rigid business models or orthodox corporatism, prioritize building networks of passionate patrons over mindlessly building more games. Cultivate and curate on-demand, in-demand playful experiences.</p>
												<p>This chapter argues that there is nothing glamorous in the cliches of the starving artist or the incorruptible, unsullied indie dev. We do live in a post-McLuhan world and the stories of how your things get made and how people find them are as significant to the experience as the game itself.</p>

						<div class="inner">
							<h1>The <i>Punk Playthings</i> Manifesto</h1>
							<p>Uncertainty and change surround us. Game makers exist in a state of flux – with all that was solid melted into air. We must embrace the unknown and adapt. Seeking refuge in old certainties leaves us blind and immutable, groping for answers and retreating into orthodoxy.</p>
							<p>Orthodoxy manifests in numerous ways: prescriptive processes deny adaptability, knowledge silos result in bunker mentalities, defined industry pathways negate artistic expression, identity ghettos restrict opportunity. All propel our medium and its artifacts into a creative cul-de-sac that negates meaning, resonance and sustainability.</p>
							<p>Games are simultaneously eating and starving themselves. We need more diversity and sustenance in our diet. Know your context and become a curious explorer, ruthless remixer and imaginative conspirator. Be open, expressive and insightful. Be maverick, fluid and playful. Be truly independent of mind. Here's how:</p>
